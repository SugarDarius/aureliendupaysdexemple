# What is Arks?

Arks is (or more accurately was) an **opinitated** open source [React](https://react.dev/) framework for creating, developing, building and shipping isomorphic web apps.
It is built on top of [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/).

All the parts of an Arks project are made to be used in a **strict** and **defined**
context.
