# A word about Arks

Arks is (or more accurately was) an **opinionated** open source [React](https://react.dev/) framework for creating, developing, building and shipping isomorphic web apps.
It is built on top of [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/).

All the parts of an Arks project are made to be used in a **strict** and **defined**
context.

The main goal of Arks was to use <InlineCode>@arks/cli</InlineCode> to mount an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server to serve a server side rendered React app and let developers **focus more** on fast implementation without to be worried on all the config part to enable server rendering with the router and GraphQL.
Arks was a project divided into several packages and server was coming with included features like monitoring and health checks.

If the experience was successful Arks was made originally to be driven by the community.

## Why the project is now a public archive?

I first created Arks as a personal goal and as an experimental project. I wanted to build a tool with the ease of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to use a cli to create and run projects.
Because back at the time I was working at the Luxembourg Stock Exchange as a consultant for the front-end web apps and I saw we were struggling at bootstrapping projects using React Router and Apollo GraphQL.

I wanted to open source the project as for it was important to let developers and the community to be part of it.

Shortly after the release of the version <InlineCode>0.1.11</InlineCode> back in July 2020 my personal goals changed and I saw [Remix](https://remix.run/) was coming and under development.
Based on my understanding of Remix I right away thought that Remix was a better option for what Arks was trying to reach.
So I decided to move on and let the repository as it was (without any real communication on it) and see what happens.

In May 2024 I decided to make the repo as a public archived as I didn't maintained the project at all for four years.

In the end for me it was a good personal experience to implement Arks because I learnt a lot on subjects like creating and using a cli and giving developers a tool to use to easily create projects.
